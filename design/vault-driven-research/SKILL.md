STARTER_CHARACTER = 🔬

Research [TOPIC] using the Vault methodology: structure first, research in parallel, synthesize into a tight summary.

## Step 1: Identify Pillars

Determine every dimension of the topic that matters. Adapt to the subject — common pillars include:
- Users and stakeholders
- Market and competitors
- Technology and constraints
- Risks and unknowns
- Economics and trade-offs
- Legal/regulatory (if relevant)

Write a prioritized pillar list. Drop pillars that don't apply.

## Step 2: Research Each Pillar in Parallel

For each pillar, gather:
- Sources and links
- Raw notes and extracts
- What each source supports or contradicts

Run across all pillars concurrently, not sequentially.

## Step 3: Synthesize Per Pillar

Distill each pillar into:
- What matters (key facts and signals)
- What's uncertain (gaps, conflicting sources)
- Decisions and assumptions forced by the evidence
- Minimum facts needed to act correctly

## Step 4: Cross-Synthesize

Do one pass across all pillars:
- Resolve conflicts between pillars
- Identify cross-cutting themes
- Surface the open questions that most affect the decision

## Step 5: Write the Summary

Target: 2 pages. Hard limit: 5 pages.

Structure:
- **Executive summary** — one paragraph, the essential conclusion
- **Key findings** — per pillar, bullets only, no padding
- **Cross-cutting insights** — what emerged from connecting the pillars
- **Open questions** — the uncertainties that still matter
- **Conclusion** — what to do or decide, grounded in the findings

## Anti-patterns

- Writing the summary before finishing synthesis
- Exceeding 5 pages (more text is not more insight — cut ruthlessly)
- Listing per-pillar findings without the cross-synthesis step
- Treating source volume as a proxy for confidence
